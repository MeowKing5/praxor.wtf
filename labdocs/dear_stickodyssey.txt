[*] Alright. Enough of the plans. It's time to yap.

Hey! It's me, praxor. Your best friend. Why am I doing this? A special someone told me I could fix my problems if I just used my words. Martin Luther King also said this, happy black history month! Anyways, if you're reading this, you may be asking: "Why are you writing this, praxor?" I just answered that question, I will not be answering it again. Next question. "What is gonna happen to us?" The damage is already done. At least now, I wish I took some of it back. Next question. "Haven't you done enough already? Why the fuck are you making this a big thing?" I am not making this a big thing. This document can only be found by typing the actual URL itself, therefore it's not being broadcasted or advertised. Not even in my server. I also answered why I am doing this. To communicate my issues. "What the fuck is wrong with you?" A lot. "Get the fuck out of my house!" No.

You see, for the greatest time, I have been confused, uninformed even. You see, when it comes to internet drama, it doesn't get this big. Plus, if we were IRL friends, we'd be able to dispute this within probably mere minutes. You know, because you can have an actual conversation and not yell behind a broken window of hope. So I thought it would be best to dispute this using a message. A message of truth, a message of lies, a message of regret, and a message of fear. 

[*] THIS IS WHERE I THINK IT ALL STARTED.
- Me dating milk, and how I felt

I forgot what day, nor does it matter. HOWEVER! This is around the time where I start dating milk. You know, life is great. You find people you're interested in, and you try to have a relationship with those people. Whether it be friendship, or just being in love with another person. This can mean many things, but it was when I had feelings for milk. You see, I thought she was so cool, so I took an interest in her. Everything went fine... until she got sexual with everything. Like, I'd be talking and she'd be hella desperate for me in a sexual way (I still have the DMs if you're interested!). Now, you may notice I can handle such a thing now, but you know how it is when you're like, you know, Extra horny for no reason. That's milk! But, 24/7. Couldn't handle it, don't blame me for why I broke off with her. I don't know if she said this, but I tried to get back with milk, but as cautious of me that she was, it was more of a silent decline. Later in the relationship I couldn't handle it, and was there merely for pity. I'm a nice guy, what can I say! I don't like breaking people's hearts. However, even after we distanced, she'd come to me for advice. I never wanted to be rude to anyone, and all my little tricks and gags n' shit were just me teasing. If I broke something, I was quick to fix it, right? Obviously. No one could accept the fact that I was normal. But let's save that sob story for later.

[*] THE GROUP CHAT
- and why everyone kicked me and blake out for some reason

Now, from my perspective, I learned a lot about you guys. I loved hanging out with you guys, yall were like my besties for a while, and I loved having you around. For some reason, the first group chat went dead, and I found out that you guys were excluding us from playing Minecraft with yall, because we were profiting on the server? Sharing is caring, yall! Why would you get petty over me and blake villager farming bro... What really confused me is that in part 2 of this, excluding thing, blake was let back but apparently I wasn't allowed to play because of larvi?? Yall literally allowed him to stay in Jumbos "unofficially" after I left. Alright. Feeling teary eyed... not really... *snif sniff*... here comes the sob story...

[*] The Sob Story
- "What the fuck did I do??"

For some odd reason, you guys just left me out in most of the activities. We were literally friends, like what? Am I just not good enough for you guys? Am I annoying? That's how I felt, because everyone would close the door, or turn away from me when I asked. All I was able to figure out was from either Turio or Berh, which were basically my REAL friends in Jumbos. Quite literally before this, exclusion, I knew that I was gonna have a problem with Stick being the owner and stuff, mainly because of the fact that people were getting thrown and tossed around when it came to group membership. Kicking and reinviting, kicking and reinviting. Now comes the part where I'm reinvited to Jumbos. This part's kinda blurry, besides the fact that you guys weren't okay with Berh. I understand that Stick and Berh had problems, but this is one of the reasons why I thought being owner would be better. Hell, even Turio could've been owner! He probably went inactive because he was busy, and so did me. We have lives, for crying out loud! Now, you might be able to understand why me and Berh had issues with milk, on the other hand. Yes! We're all friends in the end, or we used to be, but like this was also before and after Milk and Berh dated. You might understand the issues here because you know, Berh being 12 and Milk being 13, Berh is gonna be the child here and be like "Yo! What the fuck milk!" It's what happens, do you gotta blame him for that? Yeah, we called milk a whore in unison, because that's literally who she is. We can blame her for that, we have evidence of all of it. Maybe it was milk's fault all along, but you should've understood that Stick and done something about it. Maybe we didn't communicate because we didn't know how to, but you shouldn't get pissy over it because that's not what friends do to each other. I left with Berh, because I admired how he was being more of an adult in the situation. When I said I was never coming back, that was not the adult thing to do. I was clearly upset that you guys were tossing Berh around like a bean bag in Pre-K, and did a childish thing like that. Ok. I'm out of tissues, so the sob story is over. Feel free to grade my essay while you're reading, btw. NEXT SECTION!!!

[*] The Silence
- "..."

You know what happens when you leave society? Well, Jumbos kinda was my society. It was quiet for a good bit, all I had was me and Berh. Now that I think about it, we've literally been through it all, ever since the beginning of the friend group. I was kinda just vibing with Berh for a while. Good times those were. I put this next part into GreenText format, so it's easier to read.
>*get's kicked from jumbos :o*
>realize i have a whole discord server dedicated to praxor fans
>grow it kinda
>realize activity isn't activity-ing
>think of solutions
>find a solution
>start an online uprising because i love feeding off the rage of others like a sicko

[*] I try to attack Jumbos
- "BREAKING NEWS: Praxor loves drama???         WHAT"

Hey! I know that game, Cult Of The Lamb, right? I basically convert my Discord Server into a cult (you can join at https://discord.gg/rjZHDCT2MW btw everyone affiliated with Jumbos was unbanned) and used my power to vent to everyone how much I didn't like Stick. This was just a vent, but this vent turned into something greater. You see, macintoshing was never a good guy, I mean he's barely funny and annoying 99% of the time now because he does the most random fucking shit. So much for "acquaintances" (i can't spell did i spell that right). Oh yeah, my "acquaintance" sent nudes to my ex. RED FLAG MUCH?? WHY WOULD YOU SEND NUDES BSF RIGHT AFTER DATING ME??? Anyways...

[*] The Macintoshing Situation
- ...and all of it's glory.

Here's how I remember it. I probably should've wrote it down. Milk dms me about the fact that she and mac exchanged nudes. I'm like "Bro doesn't this shit make you uncomfy??" Shes like "yeah but idc!" Yeah well I'm dialing Jesus Christ himself's number rn bc you're getting your Christianity License revoked, ma'am! Macintoshing was... unnecessarily odd in this situation. You see, I had screenshots of him with his pants down, right? Oddly enough, I was like "Oh yeah. I'm gonna get them good with this one." You know, like I was a news reporter!! Gotta get the story to feed the kids somehow, and mac was #1 pedo on the headings. Now, not like i'd go walk down to my local coffee shop and buy a newspaper for probably 2$, bc you know, inflation, and see "NO WAY GUYS MAC EXPOSED PEDO??? WHAT THE SKIBID". That would actually go hard ngl. Only if someone would communicate to me directly to stop me... Speaking of stopping me, here's my next reason:

[*] The Absent Period 
- "Jumbos... disappears?"

After I gently exposed mac for being a creeper, not Minecraft, and framing him for being a pedo, I kinda just sat there. I had some good times, bro! You can see on my Medal profile that I was just having so much fun. I would constantly think to myself: "What if Jumbos was normal? What if I could have a decent time with Stick and everyone?" Yeah, well I kinda turned a blind eye to my society because I was so stuck up my ass with power I didn't realize my server were my true friends, honestly I was just missing. Not the point. I was kinda just happy with the fact that I was able to talk to Milk and Turio, well Turio sometimes, and then have my depression outbursts sometimes here and there, sorry Turio (x6). But then I get a message, a message from milk. What is it, I'm doing what I thought Jumbos was doing to me all along, just tossing me around because I was the weird one. Poor sleepypilled tbh. Not the point. I think I've gone off topic like several times... anyways... Milk in general chat just watching it happen, just DMs me, asking shady stuff like "Would you be friends with someone if they were interesting in sexual relations with a minor?" and obviously I was just CONFUSED as fuck, like I thought she was asking me to like be friends with a pedo. Now, this is the internet, and I understand if someone's changed, hence sleepypilled, but you know, I thought she was talking about sleepypilled and not this other figure I will get to in the next chapter. I was having a fun time hanging out with my members, and all of a sudden she starts getting very vague with what she's telling me. She's over here talking to me about some "Yeah. It's good to know you wanna help. We both thought you would just be upset." FORESHADOWING. So I'm just now upset because Milk doesn't tell me who this special guest is and then she's like "Okay, b-b-baka... It's TURIO!" and im just like WHAT THE FUCK! Nah, she's lying!!!! There's no wa- [screensh*ots] oh fuck here we go

[*] The Turio Situation
- "There's no way my little Turio could be a suspected pedophile!" (this is an oreimo reference)

I get filled with utter rage. I am upset. I throw things around in my room. I am lost. I am confused. All of these feelings, it was just enough to make me go insane. All of this.. this drama for what? To learn my friend sexted my ex a whole fucking year ago and NEVER CONFRONTED ME ABOUT IT?? Yeah, I was fucking upset. I cried a bit while typing a remorseful message. I darted to my mini-friend group, you know, "Friend Group A" as some may call it. I quickly acquire and abuse my resources I'd been collecting for emergency purposes and put them in The Repository. Not DoxBin, the special needs center. I nearly swear to god fucking ruined Mac because I thought this was his doing. After all, who wants to know their best friend of 7 years just all of a sudden started liking children. No. I didn't accept it. There was no way this was real. I close my Discord server to public invite and inform everyone. 

- [!] The Silence Is Deafening

I didn't want to be on Discord for a couple days. I had passed my account to a good friend to respond for me to some messages. Other than that, I isolated and calmed down. I realized what I did was a bit wrong. I just straight up dropped everyone related to Jumbos into the file shredder. This, this childish act. I should've honestly done something different and I was starting to dreadfully regret it. This reputation, this infamous reputation you could say. I was praxor, and I was tough. Nah, I lost. I really lost. I thought putting villians in the slammer was a good idea. I practically just removed my objective within mere seconds because I blamed Jumbos for turning Turio into a sex-hungry, rated-R monster. 

- [!] A still shot of a beach at 19:27. The calm noise of the water splashing onto the shore spoke words of release. 

I talk to Turio, the man himself. From my perspective, I just took action, and that was that. His perspective, however, was greatly different. I didn't want to acknowledge what I had done was wrong, I thought I was bringing criminals to justice. I was in fact, not doing that. I had ruined this guy's life. Framed him to be someone he isn't. That's not what a good news reporter does. A good news reporter would tell his boss to fucking cram it and you'd tell the truth yourself. The truth speaks more words than a lie. A lie is a placeholder, a placeholder for the truth. I wasn't filling that "truth" gap. 

[*] The Recovery Plan
- "yo wait, Turio ain't like that.. i know he aint...."

I'm just talking with Turio on Steam, you know, being there for Turio helped me better understand the entire situation. How did I start talking to Turio again? Well, you see, I never had anyone except milk blocked during The Turio Situation. When I started talking to Turio, I kinda unblocked milk because idk i just didnt care after that... Anyways... I talk with Turio and I learn a lot more. You know, when you actually talk to someone you can communicate about how you feel about things, and Turio actually told me that he didn't know that Milk was the one who went behind his back to reveal this scandal to me! I was shocked, it was like all this time Milk was flexing these screenshots to me and I wasn't understanding how wrong it was, mainly because I'm fucked up, but at the same time I didn't realize that maybe the real person in the wrong was Milk. I sorta forgave Mac for his weird antics trying to get nudes out of milk, after realizing it was more of a both parties were horny type situation. NOT THE POINT. I talked to Turio and learned more about Jumbos and how they changed over the years. I was proud. I was ready to come back, for real this time. Turns out I left on my own lol. Yeah. Not my proudest fap, but next. The Recovery Plan was to get Turio back into his popular spot with the false accusations removed, and we instead attack Milk. Speaking of attacking Milk, here's the next frame.

[*] The Milk Situation
- "dear god, i am satan. where is my candy? please give it back."

The final yap begins with these words: "What did Milk do wrong?" Everything. They ruined my relationships, and they costed me relations with my friends. You know, now that I think about it, Milk is the whole reason I am not in Jumbos anymore! Like, come on, they kept treating her better because she blamed me for "being bad", when she was the bad one all along. I am saying this as if I am not talking to you guys right now, but honestly I wanted to show everyone this. I am not going to though. Duh? I legit said that at the beginning? I think I did, I'm kinda too lazy to scroll back up. So what is my master plan? KICK MILK OFF DISCORD!!! RAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA- Wait. I did that, didn't I? "Oops." -Turio Anyways... What did milk do to deserve this?

- [!] WHAT SHE DID!!! ----->

I actually have a whole list prepared for you, take a lil' looksies if you want. Come on, I'm not tryna tease you, just look!

[x] Hoed down praxor
[x] Hoed down berh
- [x] Flexed to me about it
[x] Hoed down mac (both ways actually)
- [x] Flexed to me about it
[x] Hoed down Turio
- [x] Flexed(?) to me about it
[x] Hoed down IRL kid (not really, it was more of a him hoeing her down and,, ykw whatever)
- [x] Forced to cough it up
[ ] Hoed down the reader of this document (nah lol not even the school slut want u, for some reason)
[x] Hoed down your mom (X marks the spot lil nigga)

Ok now that you know what she did now you can understand why I was being a wee woo crybaby bitch about it. You might also understand how me and berh saw her differently, because you know, *homie hopping* is a bit wild for a 8th grader on discord... Me and berh were just the first ones to you know, take action against it. That milkussy is not worth it. Oh? Next section? My fault homie, let me get to that.

[*] Judgement Day
- "not sans related, but there is a sans praxor sticker if you want it: https://media.discordapp.net/stickers/1195952432748970065.webp"

So here I am. It's me, praxor. You know, the yapster of all time. Been typing for a while, and this actually took like three days to write. You might've begun to think at first that this was some sort of threat, or a way to attack you. I have apparently changed. I learned that sometimes, fighting is just not the way to go. I really hope you can understand by now since you've grown as a person that you can do something for me. I have an offer of sorts. It's simple, really. I am the one who started this, warfare with your friend group, and I sincerely apologize. That's kinda why I made this document, to communicate. You ever take a test before? Well, in order for you to submit your answer, you will have to communicate, too. My terms are as follows:

I get:
[Jumbos Membership Pass] or [StickOdyssey Verified Contact Card]
[Your friendship] or [Acquaintance-ship??? is that even a real thing?]
You get:
[A formal apology]
[Actual friendship]
[My compliance with your rules]
["Slander" removed]
[Praxorian Certified Sniff Sticker]
- [Written on the box: "It really smells like praxor!]
[The Praxor Society Club Invitation] <-- you are already unbanned you get it either way lol

Once again, I kinda regret being a dick to everyone and everyone you know, bro. It was very childish of me. You don't even have to respond to this, as you're not obligated to, but you should definitely hear me out on this one. Then again, if you don't respond, I kinda get free reign to make that Jumbos video, and show everyone this message. Not like it's gonna do anything, but it's worth a shot. Enough with the threats. Just talk to me.

[A] Tell me to fuck off and move on
[B] Ignore and move on
[C] Accept my apology and communicate back to me, partially happy with some terms.
[D] Accept my apology and communicate back to me, fully content with my terms.

Yeah. One question test, it should be your favorite exam by this point, as it's the easiest fucking test in the world. My DMs are literally open to anyone, so you don't even have to friend me for this to work. 

[*] Special Section! Thank you for reading!
- "What? This wasn't in the script--"

You know that one time when me and Turio were camping that VC, waiting for you to join? Just wanted to let you know, I didn't want to make this a big thing in the first place. Have fun knowing this information.

Signing out,
