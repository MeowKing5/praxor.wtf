Hey, you! Yes, you! I need your help!

If you clicked this link, I would really love it so much if you could give me your praxor fan art!
Even if you don't know how to draw, a simple stick figure resembling me is cool, too!

If you don't know already, here are some inspiration pictures that you can use to draw me!

You might be wondering, why would I need such things?
Well, you see:

1. I can use your art for my next website design!
2. I personally enjoy seeing others draw me, and I am not biased as to who draws me, as long as I think it's cool, and I pretty much think all art is cool, it's cool! Now count how many time's I said "cool" in this reason.
3. I'm praxor, so obviously I'm cool.

If you have already created fan art, or have made fan art for me, feel free to contact me on:

Discord: @praxor

That's all, have a blessed, uhh... day?
