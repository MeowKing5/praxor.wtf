*Hi.*

<hr>

*Yes, this website is hosted using GitHub Pages. I wanted to host it by myself, but I thought it would be easier to just use GitHub Pages, as my code is publically available, as it should be for other HTML students that also want to learn HTML. They can look at my live example of a portfolio that I created here. With that being said...*<br>
