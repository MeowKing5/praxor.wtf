                <p style="padding:4px;">It has recently come to my attention that my website has been stolen. While I try my hardest to conjure a new design, after recently having to delete my old website, PLEASE do note that I am currently working with school issues and I could potentially just start using this as a file server link. Goodbye for now, as I continue to be who I am currently. Stuck.</p>
