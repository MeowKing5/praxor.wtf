this is so fucking dumb but im doing it anyways

Blue, blue, blue.
It's probably not your fault
But I am blaming you
adieu, adieu.
It could have been normal
It could have been not
You all think I am a joke
And now I'm distraught
Either definition works
I'm gone now
And it's all because of you.

im gonna quit discord
see you on a random p2p client
